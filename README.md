# Air pollution and conflict in West Africa
Despite the recent remarkable economic growth, accompanied by a substantial rise in ambient air pollution, the conflict in West Africa has shown no signs of improvement. Does worsening air pollution affect conflict? Using grid-level data from 16 West African countries (2003-2009), This thesis examines the effect of exposure to ambient air pollution on conflict. For identification strategies, I estimate models with high dimensional fixed effects and instrumental variables using dust from the Saharan desert during the Harmattan season. The findings suggest that air pollution does increase the probability and intensity of conflicts. For instance, a one standard deviation increase in air pollution (0.03 mg/m3) raises the likelihood of conflict outbreak by 0.015\% and fatalities by 0.09\%. These small but causal effects are robust to alternative specifications, standard error adjustments, alternative conflict datasets, and placebo tests. Using a general equilibrium model of insurgency, I explore potential mechanisms and reveal that agricultural productivity and a rise in health expenditure could be transmission channels between air pollution and conflict. There are heterogeneous effects across military expenditure, institutional development, and urban and rural areas.
